# Welcome to Tetris

This project is an exploration into Elixir and Phoenix LiveView.

 This project is in progress. I will continue to update this README as I explore this new language and framework.


## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `tetris` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tetris, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/tetris](https://hexdocs.pm/tetris).



## Helpful Terminal Commands:
- `mix new <project_name>` create a new Elixir project
- `iex -S mix` interactive shell
- `mix test` run test suite

## Articles I Found Interesting and/or Helpful:
Here is an [article](https://www.google.com) that I enjoyed on Phoenix LiveView the describes what it is and when it might be the right tool for the job.
